This is the sub-repo where Generation occurs.

Structure:
- Basically looks like the inside of
GeneratorInterface/SherpaInterface/data, to tell you to work there ;-)
- added sherpa-readable datacards for processes studied
- corresponding sherpacks found in subdir sherpack/ ,
- and obtained python GEN fragment in python/ .
For example, the file Run.dat_tautaugamma[...] has its sherpack
residing in sherpack/TTG/, and the python fragment was copied to
python/.

with this directory, You can:
1/ re-run the sherpa level, in that case you should check the details of how to
run sherpa, some are given here:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/VgammaELTE

2/ use the GEN fragment directly, in conjunction with the sherpack.

happy generating
